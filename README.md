A MEAN Stack Web Application featuring events. Companies would create events for users to join.

Built while exploring Angular 2 and MEAN Stack.

## Example Pitch

Welcome to GoWhere. Having trouble deciding where to go? Can't make a decision? Not sure what exciting events are going on?
Let GoWhere help you to make that crucial decision.

We realise that most groups of friends/colleagues can't decide where to go or what to do. And there's always that guy who sits on the fence and just replies 'Anything'.

Now with GoWhere, people can view events happening in Singapore and join the event.
